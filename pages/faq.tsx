            . At release, anyone could claim loot bags for just gas, and all
            bags were claimed in under 4 hours. Each loot bag contains 8 items:
            a piece for an adventurer&apos;s chest, foot, hand, head, neck, ring,
            waist, and weapon.

            Emoji Loot is an unaudited project. Bags #1 to #7777 were claimable by
            anyone and #7778 to #8000 are currently reserved for the contract
            deployer.

          <h3>How do I value Emoji Loot bags?</h3>

            They say that value is always in the eye of the beholder. Emoji Loot is no
            different, with no explicit rarities specified at launch. How you
            value a loot bag is up to you.

            Still, the community has begun to devise many mechanisms by which to
            assess the rarity of bags and their items. Some of these include{" "}
